server and\n * channels are multiplexed over the connection.\n * Connect to the server using the `Socket` class:\n *\n * ```javascript\n *     let socket = new Socket(\"/socket\", {params: {userToken: \"123\"}})\n *     socket.connect()\n * ```\n *\n * The `Socket` constructor takes the mount point of the socket,\n * the authentication params, as well as options that can be found in\n * the Socket docs, such as configuring the `LongPoll` transport, and\n * heartbeat.\n *\n * ## Channels\n *\n * Channels are isolated, concurrent processes on the server that\n * subscribe to topics and broker events between the client and server.\n * To join a channel, you must provide the topic, and channel params for\n * authorization. Here's an example chat room example where `\"new_msg\"`\n * events are listened for, messages are pushed to the server, and\n * the channel is joined with ok/error/timeout matches:\n *\n * ```javascript\n *     let channel = socket.channel(\"room:123\", {token: roomToken})\n *     channel.on(\"new_msg\", msg => console.log(\"Got message\", msg) )\n *     $input.onEnter( e => {\n *       channel.push(\"new_msg\", {body: e.target.val}, 10000)\n *        .receive(\"ok\", (msg) => console.log(\"created message\", msg) )\n *        .receive(\"error\", (reasons) => console.log(\"create failed\", reasons) )\n *        .receive(\"timeout\", () => console.log(\"Networking issue...\") )\n *     })\n *     channel.join()\n *       .receive(\"ok\", ({messages}) => console.log(\"catching up\", messages) )\n *       .receive(\"error\", ({reason}) => console.log(\"failed join\", reason) )\n *       .receive(\"timeout\", () => console.log(\"Networking issue. Still waiting...\") )\n *```\n *\n * ## Joining\n *\n * Creating a channel with `socket.channel(topic, params)`, binds the params to\n * `channel.params`, which are sent up on `channel.join()`.\n * Subsequent rejoins will send up the modified params for\n * updating authorization params, or passing up last_message_id information.\n * Successful joins receive an \"ok\" status, while unsuccessful joins\n * receive \"error\".\n *\n * ## Duplicate Join Subscriptions\n *\n * While the client may join any number of topics on any number of channels,\n * the client may only hold a single subscription for each unique topic at any\n * given time. When attempting to create a duplicate subscription,\n * the server will close the existing channel, log a warning, and\n * spawn a new channel for the topic. The client will have their\n * `channel.onClose` callbacks fired for the existing channel, and the new\n * channel join will have its receive hooks processed as normal.\n *\n * ## Pushing Messages\n *\n * From the previous example, we can see that pushing messages to the server\n * can be done with `channel.push(eventName, payload)` and we can optionally\n * receive responses from the push. Additionally, we can use\n * `receive(\"timeout\", callback)` to abort waiting for our other `receive` hooks\n *  and take action after some period of waiting. The default timeout is 5000ms.\n *\n *\n * ## Socket Hooks\n *\n * Lifecycle events of the multiplexed connection can be hooked into via\n * `socket.onError()` and `socket.onClose()` events, ie:\n *\n * ```javascript\n *     socket.onError( () => console.log(\"there was an error with the connection!\") )\n *     socket.onClose( () => console.log(\"the connection dropped\") )\n * ```\n *\n *\n * ## Channel Hooks\n *\n * For each joined channel, you can bind to `onError` and `onClose` events\n * to monitor the channel lifecycle, ie:\n *\n * ```javascript\n *     channel.onError( () => console.log(\"there was an error!\") )\n *     channel.onClose( () => console.log(\"the channel has gone away gracefully\") )\n * ```\n *\n * ### onError hooks\n *\n * `onError` hooks are invoked if the socket connection drops, or the channel\n * crashes on the server. In either case, a channel rejoin is attempted\n * automatically in an exponential backoff manner.\n *\n * ### onClose hooks\n *\n * `onClose` hooks are invoked only in two cases. 1) the channel explicitly\n * closed on the server, or 2). The client explicitly closed, by calling\n * `channel.leave()`\n *\n *\n * ## Presence\n *\n * The `Presence` object provides features for syncing presence information\n * from the server with the client and handling presences joining and leaving.\n *\n * ### Syncing initial state from the server\n *\n * `Presence.syncState` is used to sync the list of presences on the server\n * with the client's state. An optional `onJoin` and `onLeave` callback can\n * be provided to react to changes in the client's local presences across\n * disconnects and reconnects with the server.\n *\n * `Presence.syncDiff` is used to sync a diff of presence join and leave\n * events from the server, as they happen. Like `syncState`, `syncDiff`\n * accepts optional `onJoin` and `onLeave` callbacks to react to a user\n * joining or leaving from a device.\n *\n * ### Listing Presences\n *\n * `Presence.list` is used to return a list of presence information\n * based on the local state of metadata. By default, all presence\n * metadata is returned, but a `listBy` function can be supplied to\n * allow the client to select which metadata to use for a given presence.\n * For example, you may have a user online from different devices with\n * a metadata status of \"online\", but they have set themselves to \"away\"\n * on another device. In this case, the app may choose to use the \"away\"\n * status for what appears on the UI. The example below defines a `listBy`\n * function which prioritizes the first metadata which was registered for\n * each user. This could be the first tab they opened, or the first device\n * they came online from:\n *\n * ```javascript\n *     let state = {}\n *     state = Presence.syncState(state, stateFromServer)\n *     let listBy = (id, {metas: [first, ...rest]}) => {\n *       first.count = rest.length + 1 // count of this user's presences\n *       first.id = id\n *       return first\n *     }\n *     let onlineUsers = Presence.list(state, listBy)\n * ```\n *\n *\n * ### Example Usage\n *```javascript\n *     // detect if user has joined for the 1st time or from another tab/device\n *     let onJoin = (id, current, newPres) => {\n *       if(!current){\n *         console.log(\"user has entered for the first time\", newPres)\n *       } else {\n *         console.log(\"user additional presence\", newPres)\n *       }\n *     }\n *     // detect if user has left from all tabs/devices, or is still present\n *     let onLeave = (id, current, leftPres) => {\n *       if(current.metas.length === 0){\n *         console.log(\"user has left from all devices\", leftPres)\n *       } else {\n *         console.log(\"user left from a device\", leftPres)\n *       }\n *     }\n *     let presences = {} // client's initial empty presence state\n *     // receive initial presence data from server, sent after join\n *     myChannel.on(\"presence_state\", state => {\n *       presences = Presence.syncState(presences, state, onJoin, onLeave)\n *       displayUsers(Presence.list(presences))\n *     })\n *     // receive \"presence_diff\" from server, containing join/leave events\n *     myChannel.on(\"presence_diff\", diff => {\n *       presences = Presence.syncDiff(presences, diff, onJoin, onLeave)\n *       this.setState({users: Presence.list(room.presences, listBy)})\n *     })\n * ```\n * @module phoenix\n */\n\nconst VSN = \"2.0.0\"\nconst SOCKET_STATES = {connecting: 0, open: 1, closing: 2, closed: 3}\nconst DEFAULT_TIMEOUT = 10000\nconst WS_CLOSE_NORMAL = 1000\nconst CHANNEL_STATES = {\n  closed: \"closed\",\n  errored: \"errored\",\n  joined: \"joined\",\n  joining: \"joining\",\n  leaving: \"leaving\",\n}\nconst CHANNEL_EVENTS = {\n  close: \"phx_close\",\n  error: \"phx_error\",\n  join: \"phx_join\",\n  reply: \"phx_reply\",\n  leave: \"phx_leave\"\n}\nconst CHANNEL_LIFECYCLE_EVENTS = [\n  CHANNEL_EVENTS.close,\n  CHANNEL_EVENTS.error,\n  CHANNEL_EVENTS.join,\n  CHANNEL_EVENTS.reply,\n  CHANNEL_EVENTS.leave\n]\nconst TRANSPORTS = {\n  longpoll: \"longpoll\",\n  websocket: \"websocket\"\n}\n\n/**\n * Initializes the Push\n * @param {Channel} channel -

If a work-in-progress render is discarded before\n// finishing, we create a new work-in-progress by cloning the current queue.\n//\n// Both queues share a persistent, singly-linked list structure. To schedule an\n// update, we append it to the end of both queues. Each queue maintains a\n// pointer to first update in the persistent list that hasn't been processed.\n// The work-in-progress pointer always has a position equal to or greater than\n// the current queue, since we always work on that one. The current queue's\n// pointer is only updated during the commit phase, when we swap in the\n// work-in-progress.\n//\n// For example:\n//\n//   Current pointer:           A - B - C - D - E - F\n//   Work-in-progress pointer:              D - E - F\n//                                          ^\n//                                          The work-in-progress queue has\n//                                          processed more updates than current.\n//\n// The reason we append to both queues is because otherwise we might drop\n// updates without ever processing them. For example, if we only add updates to\n// the work-in-progress queue, some updates could be lost whenever a work-in\n// -progress render restarts by cloning from current. Similarly, if we only add\n// updates to the current queue, the updates will be lost whenever an already\n// in-progress queue commits and swaps with the current queue. However, by\n// adding to both queues, we guarantee that the update will be part of the next\n// work-in-progress. (And because the work-in-progress queue becomes the\n// current queue once it commits, there's no danger of applying the same\n// update twice.)\n//\n// Prioritization\n// --------------\n//\n// Updates are not sorted by priority, but by insertion; new updates are always\n// appended to the end of the list.\n//\n// The priority is still important, though. When processing the update queue\n// during the render phase, only the updates with sufficient priority are\n// included in the result. If we skip an update because it has insufficient\n// priority, it remains in the queue to be processed later, during a lower\n// priority render. Crucially, all updates subsequent to a skipped update also\n// remain in the queue *regardless of their priority*. That means high priority\n// updates are sometimes processed twice, at two separate priorities. We also\n// keep track of a base state, that represents the state before the first\n// update in the queue is applied.\n//\n// For example:\n//\n//   Given a base state of '', and the following queue of updates\n//\n//     A1 - B2 - C1 - D2\n//\n//   where the number indicates the priority, and the update is applied to the\n//   previous state by appending a letter, React will process these updates as\n//   two separate renders, one per distinct priority level:\n//\n//   First render, at priority 1:\n//     Base state: ''\n//     Updates: [A1, C1]\n//     Result state: 'AC'\n//\n//   Second render, at priority 2:\n//     Base state: 'A'            <-  The base state does not include C1,\n//                                    because B2 was skipped.\n//     Updates: [B2, C1, D2]      <-  C1 was rebased on top of B2\n//     Result state: 'ABCD'\n//\n// Because we process updates in insertion order, and rebase high priority\n// updates when preceding updates are skipped, the final result is deterministic\n// regardless of priority. Intermediate state may vary according to system\n// resources, but the final state is always the same.\n\nvar UpdateState = 0;\nvar ReplaceState = 1;\nvar ForceUpdate = 2;\nvar CaptureUpdate = 3;\n\n// Global state that is reset at the beginning of calling `processUpdateQueue`.\n// It should only be read right after calling `processUpdateQueue`, via\n// `checkHasForceUpdateAfterProcessing`.\nvar hasForceUpdate = false;\n\nvar didWarnUpdateInsideUpdate = void 0;\nvar currentlyProcessingQueue = void 0;\nvar resetCurrentlyProcessingQueue = void 0;\n{\n  didWarnUpdateInsideUpdate = false;\n  currentlyProcessingQueue = null;\n  resetCurrentlyProcessingQueue = function () {\n    currentlyProcessingQueue = null;\n  };\n}\n\nfunction createUpdateQueue(baseState) {\n  var queue = {\n    expirationTime: NoWork,\n    baseState: baseState,\n    firstUpdate: null,\n    lastUpdate: null,\n    firstCapturedUpdate: null,\n    lastCapturedUpdate: null,\n    firstEffect: null,\n    lastEffect: null,\n    firstCapturedEffect: null,\n    lastCapturedEffect: null\n  };\n  return queue;\n}\n\nfunction cloneUpdateQueue(currentQueue) {\n  var queue = {\n    expirationTime: currentQueue.expirationTime,\n    baseState: currentQueue.baseState,\n    firstUpdate: currentQueue.firstUpdate,\n    lastUpdate: currentQueue.lastUpdate,\n\n    // TODO: With resuming, if we bail out and resuse the child tree, we should\n    // keep these effects.\n    firstCapturedUpdate: null,\n    lastCapturedUpdate: null,\n\n    firstEffect: null,\n    lastEffect: null,\n\n    firstCapturedEffect: null,\n    lastCapturedEffect: null\n  };\n  return queue;\n}\n\nfunction createUpdate(expirationTime) {\n  return {\n    expirationTime: expirationTime,\n\n    tag: UpdateState,\n    payload: null,\n    callback: null,\n\n    next: null,\n    nextEffect: null\n  };\n}\n\nfunction appendUpdateToQueue(queue, update, expirationTime) {\n  // Append the update to the end of the list.\n  if (queue.lastUpdate === null) {\n    // Queue is empty\n    queue.firstUpdate = queue.lastUpdate = update;\n  } else {\n    queue.lastUpdate.next = update;\n    queue.lastUpdate = update;\n  }\n  if (queue.expirationTime === NoWork || queue.expirationTime > expirationTime) {\n    // The incoming update has the earliest expiration of any update in the\n    // queue.
